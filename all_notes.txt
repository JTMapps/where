The term constant implies that the magnetic field does not change as time changes.  It doesn’t necessarily tell us about  variation of the magnetic field in space. A uniform magnetic field is one where the strength and direction of the field are the same at every point within a specified area. Homogeneous is used to emphasize that the properties of the field are the same throughout the entire volume of space. 
An anode near the tip of the tube through which the electrons are projected helps accelerate them outward. 
Yes, it is the smallest observable charge that can be found in nature. 
The helium gas in the tube with the electrons to form ions, and in this reaction the electron releases energy in the form of a photon. it is blue because the shorter wavelenghts of the visible light spectrum are observed. 
Helmholtz-tubes be used to study the motion of a charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field.
Plasma is a state of matter fromed when a gas becomes so hot that its atoms are ionized
Yes. But there are significant practical challenges to consider. Protons are much heavier than electrons, and their charge-to-mass ratio is correspondingly smaller. This means that for a given magnetic field and voltage, the radius of curvature for protons would be much larger than for electrons, making the experiment more difficult to set up and requiring more space.
Yes electrons can be controlled by a magnetic field. When electrons move through it, they'll experience a force called the Lorentz force, which causes them to move in a circular path; that is depending on their initial velocity relative to the magnetic field.
An example of this phenomena in nature. the Sun’s magnetic field also controls the flow of charged particles.
Solar flares send streams of charged particles into space, which are then guided by the Sun’s magnetic field lines, sometimes interacting with Earth’s magnetic field and causing auroras.

A process is, quite simply, an abstraction of a running program. 
process is a unique instance of a running program, and contains the values of all the variables, program counter values, and register values.

multiprogramming
Each process acts as if it has exclusive access to the CPU but, in reality, the CPU rapidly switches between the various processes in order to complete all of the instructions associated with all of them.


This describes the things all processes have in common:
A beginning (input);
An end (output);
A transition point somewhere between the beginning and the end (a state); and
An overarching action (a program).


In order to create a process, one of four things usually has to happen:
System initialisation;
A running process makes a process-creation system call;
A user requests the creation of a new process; or
A batch job is initiated.

A process usually ends as a result of one of 4 events:
Normal exit:
a voluntary termination that occurs when a process finishes its work without issues, or if the user decides to end it .
Error exit, 
Also a voluntary termination. Occurs when a process encounters an error caused by external factors (such as a user inputting bad data), and decides to stop
Fatal exit is an involuntary termination
It Occurs when a process encounters an unresolvable error caused by it's own code (think unhandled exceptions - these would cause fatal exits); and
A process can also be involuntarily killed by another process.


￼
[3-4 marks] [use in specicif case]
there are a limited number of ways in which a process can transition between these states. A blocked process, for example, has to be unblocked by another process. This means that the process cannot go from blocked to running - it has to transition to ready first. 

A thread, in simple terms, is like a process within a process. More specifically, a thread is a single, distinct set of instructions that execute sequentially within a process, and all processes therefore have at least one thread that starts when the process starts.

Dear National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) South Africa,

I am writing to express my interest in seeking support from your esteemed organization to complete my degree. As a dedicated student striving to achieve academic excellence, I believe that the financial assistance and support provided by NUM would greatly benefit me in pursuing my educational goals.

Completing my degree under the financial support of NUM would offer me the opportunity to focus on my studies without the added stress of financial burden. This support would enable me to access resources, such as textbooks, study materials, and academic tools, that are essential for my academic success. Additionally, the financial assistance provided by NUM would allow me to afford tuition fees, accommodation, and other expenses associated with pursuing a degree, ensuring that I can fully immerse myself in my studies and excel in my chosen field.

Furthermore, being supported by NUM would not only provide me with financial assistance but also connect me with a community of like-minded individuals who share a goal of empowering and supporting students in their educational endeavors. especially for a student such as myself, who i persuing a STEM related degree, i believe that the guidance, mentorship, and networking opportunities offered by NUM, an association for mineworkers, would be invaluable in shaping my academic and professional development, and I believe that being part of such a supportive and empowering organization would foster a sense of belonging and motivation to succeed.

In conclusion, I am confident that completing my degree under the financial support of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) South Africa would be a transformative experience that would not only benefit me academically but also empower me to reach my full potential as a student and future professional. I am eager to contribute to the NUM community and make the most of the opportunities and support provided by your organization.

Thank you for considering my application for support, and I look forward to the possibility of working together towards achieving academic excellence and personal growth.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

There could be a few reasons why your querySelector is returning a null element:

1. Make sure the JavaScript code is executed after the HTML document has finished loading. You can achieve this by placing your JavaScript code at the end of the HTML file, just before the closing </body> tag, or by using the DOMContentLoaded event listener.

2. Verify that the button element you are trying to select exists in the HTML file. Double-check the spelling, capitalization, and any other attributes that might affect the selection.

3. Ensure that the JavaScript file is properly linked to the HTML file. Check that the script tag referencing the JavaScript file has the correct src attribute and that the file is located in the correct directory.

4. If you are using a selector that targets a specific class or ID, ensure that the class or ID is correctly assigned to the button element in the HTML file.

Here's an example of how you can use the DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure your JavaScript code runs after the HTML document has loaded:

html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>My Page</title> </head> <body>   <button id="myButton">Click me</button>    <script src="your-script.js"></script> </body> </html> 

javascript document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {   var button = document.querySelector("#myButton");   console.log(button); // Check if the button element is correctly selected }); 

By using the DOMContentLoaded event listener, you can ensure that the JavaScript code is executed only after the HTML document has finished loading, allowing you to select the button element successfully.

تحكي العيون
كلشي مكشوف
قول لي المفروض بهالسرعة نكون
وقعنا وعلقنا
واللي على بالي مو
مركب بحروف
احكي وما احكي، اللي مخفي مكتوم
مهرب مقفول (يا حبيبي)
ما كنت متوقعة إني اغرق وأحبك عطول
ما كنت متوقعة انو الدنيا تقلب بالشقلوب
ما كنت متوقعة كم بيتغير علي المألوف
ما كنت متوقعة إني أغرق وأحبك عطول
اهدأ اهدأ، طلع عالي فيني هيك
مافي داعي ليش نخلي الخطوة خطوتين
بس كل ما اضيع بعينيك
I just break down
Try to cool down
What to do now?
بس اللي بقلبي ما بيخليني
افرق المنطق من حنيني
خايفة اصراري ما يكفيني (يا حبيبي)
ما كنت متوقعة إني اغرق وأحبك عطول
ما كنت متوقعة انو الدنيا تقلب بالشقلوب
ما كنت متوقعة كم بيتغير علي المألوف
ما كنت متوقعة إني أغرق وأحبك عطول
بليله ونهار ضحكت هاللعبة علينا
شو صار لصار
ما كنت متوقعة إني اغرق وأحبك عطول
ما كنت متوقعة انو الدنيا تقلب بالشقلوب
ما كنت متوقعة كم بيتغير علي المألوف
ما كنت متوقعة إني أغرق وأحبك عطول

letter

Good Day Mr Heinz 

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter wherein there is great difficulty regarding my academic future at NWU. I understand that my academic record has not been up to par, resulting in the discontinuation of my bursary and so preventing me from registering for the academic year of 2023. However, I am determined to rectify my mistakes and demonstrate my commitment to my education.

I would like to express my sincere regret for the poor academic performance that led to the discontinuation of my bursary. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand the consequences that have followed. However, over the past year, I have taken the time to reflect on my academic journey and identify the areas where I went wrong. And I am confident in my ability to turn things around.

I have sought guidance from proffesors, academic advisors, and fellow students to better understand the steps I need to take to improve my performance. I have also enrolled in various online courses and workshops to enhance knowledge of those topics related to my studies, study skills and time management abilities. 


I understand that my poor academic record may raise concerns about my ability to excel in my studies. However, I would like to assure you that I am fully committed to making a significant change in my approach to learning. I have developed a comprehensive study plan that includes regular study sessions, seeking additional help from professors and tutors, and actively participating in class discussions.

Moreover, over the past year i had been afforded the opportunity to work on some real world projects, which were to design web applications for the small businesses in my neighbourhood. And also, to have a view into the related IT career market. This has allowed me to develop a clearer understanding of the real-world applications of the knowledge I will acquire at NWU, further motivating me to excel academically.

I kindly request your reconsideration of my registration for the academic year of 2024. I understand that my bursary will not be reinstated, and I am prepared to explore alternative means of financing my education. I am willing to take on part-time employment or apply for scholarships to ensure that I can meet the financial obligations associated with my studies.

I genuinely believe that NWU is the ideal institution for me to pursue my academic goals and make a positive impact in my chosen field. I am confident that with the support and guidance of the esteemed faculty at NWU, I can overcome my past academic setbacks and thrive academically.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this matter further and provide any additional information that may be required. I am eager to prove my dedication and commitment to my education and would be honored to be given a chance to register for the academic year of 2024.

Yours sincerely,

M Maponya

script. 

How to Cook 
would you like to eat a cooked meal everyday? how often would you like to have a cooked meal? what do you think about eating healthy? q sick? how often would you like to cook yourself? how often would you like me to cook for you? do you make a meal after midnight? how often in a day do you think food?  


How to Sow 
do you have a fabric you like the feel of more than others? what kinda heels do you like? what kinda sneakers do you like? do you like platforms? do you like wearing skirts? are jeans too uncomfortable? how often in a week would you chill in some sweatpants? do you like your clothes to fit well, or do you prefer them a little loose? when do you like to wear your dresses?would you spend a day in sunglasses? do you like wearing watches, rings or necklaces? do you usually keep a collection of some hats? more about the plain tees or more on the graphics? would you like to keep the same shirt decent for years? how often would you like to buy yourself some drip? how often in a week would you like to be dripped out👘?  do you prefer winter clothing or summer clothing? 

 How to Clean 
is there a chore you really dont prefer to be the one doing? do you clean things up even when you don’t feel like it, or rest first? do you like to clean stuff after the first use? do you usually have a preference for how you want stuff organised? is there anything that brings you a mood that makes chores doable? how long should it take to fix a broken door handle? do small stains bother you? would you throw something away because its gotten rusty? would you consider it painful to clean a mess that wasn’t made by you? how often you like to wash your hair ? is perfume an occasional thing or for on the regular? for how long do you really like to bathe? do you like to be without shoes in our house? would you ever let the kids make a mess? is there a room in the house that should aways be kept clean? what is one thing that would calm you down if you were feeling crowded? 

How to be at Home
would you lke me to drive you to and fro work? would you like to go to a place of worship on a regular basis? would you like to attend our community’s meetings(politics)? would we visit clubs? what about quieter bars? how often would you like us to visit the 🏀courts? with to your doctors appointments? what kind of teachers would you want for your children to have? would you like to have me speak with the waiter for you? would you like me to be the one who pays for stuff at the cashier? how do you think you’d want me to behave to the women in our neighbourhood? how would you behave to the men in our neighbourhood? 
to make acquaintance with strangers? how much about your life would you like your neighbours know? would you let me put a tracker on you? would you let me put trackers on our kids? how well would you like to get to know the parents with whom’s kids yours are friends? how would wanna react to me if you feel like olwethu is overstaying his welcome? 

How to be Outside
if you couldn’t speak my language, how do you think you’d try to let me know that..? would you mind to live in a community where the laws weren’t aligned to your morals? would you go to a cinema where the movies aren’t in your language? do you have any opinion about ‘xhenophobia’? how would you wanna react if a cop was being disrespectful? if you were asked to would you be willing to say a prayer that isn’t to your god? How would it make you feel if you had to wear a hijabi to be allowed into someplace? I hear they live under socialism in russia, would you be willing to have everything and our salaries be the same as our neighbours? I hear there’s no privacy in china, would you mind to visit a place where the government monitors every phone? How would you handle managing it if our daughter was studying overseas? How would you wanna ask a jew your questions about the holocaust?

I'd tell you nges Xhosa baba .♉

Le gama ngathi ye disease. 💀

An elemental conversation. 

in this video are two kids with a goal. i'd like to note the mental dynamics there with their two elemantal virtues. where one is from the land of earth, the other from the land of fire.    

more inclined to the right-brain perspective, more aware in that carefree flow of nature, the fire nature is receptive to its e'motions'. and passionately is how fire spreads in these fluids, the feelings. the fire kid so wants to adress his discontent with their dis-harmony  

more inclined to the left-brain perspactive. more aware to the logic of cause and effect. the earth nature is so receptive to the reason. "i am doing this because", the focus is to build a map to the optimal solution, or that comfortable space. where the earth kid seeks to control how they harmonize. 

the fire kid learns from the earth, not to let their flame burn into all the fluids. reason may be employed to decipher which feelings are not-productive. so we may better align ourself to those things that are benefitial. 


the earth kid learns from the fire, not to often overlook their feelings. and to see that the is always more space to grown into.

The story is called *Seek* . 🔎 
 
your favourite colour is bleu, still you remind me of the colour pink and all the rainbow. your tongue has a different taste, still your skin is sweet. And us being together hastens the hands of our clocks. this as a bedtime story, not a rhythmn nor a lullaby. still i struggle to speak as plainly, because all my thoughts about you are poetic. we're smooth, we harmonize. your body has a language i listen, i so love how you speak to me. 
our reward won't be in the anniversares, instead in the experiences we have of us together; how well we're acquainted, this union we've come to . the feel of this wonderful web we weave . 

my love in swahili, my love in portuguesse, my love in xhosa . my love i wish this ink was coloured how your heart is patterned . say it for me to hear it in your voice . because love, for me, is weaved there in the sound of your voice.

The term constant implies that the magnetic field does not change as time changes.  It doesn’t necessarily tell us about  variation of the magnetic field in space. A uniform magnetic field is one where the strength and direction of the field are the same at every point within a specified area. Homogeneous is used to emphasize that the properties of the field are the same throughout the entire volume of space. 
An anode near the tip of the tube through which the electrons are projected helps accelerate them outward. 
Yes, it is the smallest observable charge that can be found in nature. 
The helium gas in the tube with the electrons to form ions, and in this reaction the electron releases energy in the form of a photon. it is blue because the shorter wavelenghts of the visible light spectrum are observed. 
Helmholtz-tubes be used to study the motion of a charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field.
Plasma is a state of matter fromed when a gas becomes so hot that its atoms are ionized
Yes. But there are significant practical challenges to consider. Protons are much heavier than electrons, and their charge-to-mass ratio is correspondingly smaller. This means that for a given magnetic field and voltage, the radius of curvature for protons would be much larger than for electrons, making the experiment more difficult to set up and requiring more space.
Yes electrons can be controlled by a magnetic field. When electrons move through it, they'll experience a force called the Lorentz force, which causes them to move in a circular path; that is depending on their initial velocity relative to the magnetic field.
An example of this phenomena in nature. the Sun’s magnetic field also controls the flow of charged particles.
Solar flares send streams of charged particles into space, which are then guided by the Sun’s magnetic field lines, sometimes interacting with Earth’s magnetic field and causing auroras.

A process is, quite simply, an abstraction of a running program. 
process is a unique instance of a running program, and contains the values of all the variables, program counter values, and register values.

multiprogramming
Each process acts as if it has exclusive access to the CPU but, in reality, the CPU rapidly switches between the various processes in order to complete all of the instructions associated with all of them.


This describes the things all processes have in common:
A beginning (input);
An end (output);
A transition point somewhere between the beginning and the end (a state); and
An overarching action (a program).


In order to create a process, one of four things usually has to happen:
System initialisation;
A running process makes a process-creation system call;
A user requests the creation of a new process; or
A batch job is initiated.

A process usually ends as a result of one of 4 events:
Normal exit:
a voluntary termination that occurs when a process finishes its work without issues, or if the user decides to end it .
Error exit, 
Also a voluntary termination. Occurs when a process encounters an error caused by external factors (such as a user inputting bad data), and decides to stop
Fatal exit is an involuntary termination
It Occurs when a process encounters an unresolvable error caused by it's own code (think unhandled exceptions - these would cause fatal exits); and
A process can also be involuntarily killed by another process.


￼
[3-4 marks] [use in specicif case]
there are a limited number of ways in which a process can transition between these states. A blocked process, for example, has to be unblocked by another process. This means that the process cannot go from blocked to running - it has to transition to ready first. 

A thread, in simple terms, is like a process within a process. More specifically, a thread is a single, distinct set of instructions that execute sequentially within a process, and all processes therefore have at least one thread that starts when the process starts.

Dear National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) South Africa,

I am writing to express my interest in seeking support from your esteemed organization to complete my degree. As a dedicated student striving to achieve academic excellence, I believe that the financial assistance and support provided by NUM would greatly benefit me in pursuing my educational goals.

Completing my degree under the financial support of NUM would offer me the opportunity to focus on my studies without the added stress of financial burden. This support would enable me to access resources, such as textbooks, study materials, and academic tools, that are essential for my academic success. Additionally, the financial assistance provided by NUM would allow me to afford tuition fees, accommodation, and other expenses associated with pursuing a degree, ensuring that I can fully immerse myself in my studies and excel in my chosen field.

Furthermore, being supported by NUM would not only provide me with financial assistance but also connect me with a community of like-minded individuals who share a goal of empowering and supporting students in their educational endeavors. especially for a student such as myself, who i persuing a STEM related degree, i believe that the guidance, mentorship, and networking opportunities offered by NUM, an association for mineworkers, would be invaluable in shaping my academic and professional development, and I believe that being part of such a supportive and empowering organization would foster a sense of belonging and motivation to succeed.

In conclusion, I am confident that completing my degree under the financial support of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) South Africa would be a transformative experience that would not only benefit me academically but also empower me to reach my full potential as a student and future professional. I am eager to contribute to the NUM community and make the most of the opportunities and support provided by your organization.

Thank you for considering my application for support, and I look forward to the possibility of working together towards achieving academic excellence and personal growth.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

There could be a few reasons why your querySelector is returning a null element:

1. Make sure the JavaScript code is executed after the HTML document has finished loading. You can achieve this by placing your JavaScript code at the end of the HTML file, just before the closing </body> tag, or by using the DOMContentLoaded event listener.

2. Verify that the button element you are trying to select exists in the HTML file. Double-check the spelling, capitalization, and any other attributes that might affect the selection.

3. Ensure that the JavaScript file is properly linked to the HTML file. Check that the script tag referencing the JavaScript file has the correct src attribute and that the file is located in the correct directory.

4. If you are using a selector that targets a specific class or ID, ensure that the class or ID is correctly assigned to the button element in the HTML file.

Here's an example of how you can use the DOMContentLoaded event listener to ensure your JavaScript code runs after the HTML document has loaded:

html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head>   <title>My Page</title> </head> <body>   <button id="myButton">Click me</button>    <script src="your-script.js"></script> </body> </html> 

javascript document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {   var button = document.querySelector("#myButton");   console.log(button); // Check if the button element is correctly selected }); 

By using the DOMContentLoaded event listener, you can ensure that the JavaScript code is executed only after the HTML document has finished loading, allowing you to select the button element successfully.

letter

Good Day Mr Heinz 

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter wherein there is great difficulty regarding my academic future at NWU. I understand that my academic record has not been up to par, resulting in the discontinuation of my bursary and so preventing me from registering for the academic year of 2023. However, I am determined to rectify my mistakes and demonstrate my commitment to my education.

I would like to express my sincere regret for the poor academic performance that led to the discontinuation of my bursary. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand the consequences that have followed. However, over the past year, I have taken the time to reflect on my academic journey and identify the areas where I went wrong. And I am confident in my ability to turn things around.

I have sought guidance from proffesors, academic advisors, and fellow students to better understand the steps I need to take to improve my performance. I have also enrolled in various online courses and workshops to enhance knowledge of those topics related to my studies, study skills and time management abilities. 


I understand that my poor academic record may raise concerns about my ability to excel in my studies. However, I would like to assure you that I am fully committed to making a significant change in my approach to learning. I have developed a comprehensive study plan that includes regular study sessions, seeking additional help from professors and tutors, and actively participating in class discussions.

Moreover, over the past year i had been afforded the opportunity to work on some real world projects, which were to design web applications for the small businesses in my neighbourhood. And also, to have a view into the related IT career market. This has allowed me to develop a clearer understanding of the real-world applications of the knowledge I will acquire at NWU, further motivating me to excel academically.

I kindly request your reconsideration of my registration for the academic year of 2024. I understand that my bursary will not be reinstated, and I am prepared to explore alternative means of financing my education. I am willing to take on part-time employment or apply for scholarships to ensure that I can meet the financial obligations associated with my studies.

I genuinely believe that NWU is the ideal institution for me to pursue my academic goals and make a positive impact in my chosen field. I am confident that with the support and guidance of the esteemed faculty at NWU, I can overcome my past academic setbacks and thrive academically.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this matter further and provide any additional information that may be required. I am eager to prove my dedication and commitment to my education and would be honored to be given a chance to register for the academic year of 2024.

Yours sincerely,

M Maponya

Antoniette

make my heart into an open vessel for your love
see me my visions of castles in the sky
madonna, memento vivere
you're a wonderful virtue

sleep me into the dark moon
let me into hell with you
hold on to my ribcage
pricilla proserpina, swim into my diamonds

signes cupid, and surrenders his arrows
mix into your cup my kiss and bury me a gift
they want for rhythms of romance
these are of a healing sex .

How to Cook 
would you like to eat a cooked meal everyday? how often would you like to have a cooked meal? what do you think about eating healthy? q sick? how often would you like to cook yourself? how often would you like me to cook for you? do you make a meal after midnight? how often in a day do you think food?  


How to Sow 
do you have a fabric you like the feel of more than others? what kinda heels do you like? what kinda sneakers do you like? do you like platforms? do you like wearing skirts? are jeans too uncomfortable? how often in a week would you chill in some sweatpants? do you like your clothes to fit well, or do you prefer them a little loose? when do you like to wear your dresses?would you spend a day in sunglasses? do you like wearing watches, rings or necklaces? do you usually keep a collection of some hats? more about the plain tees or more on the graphics? would you like to keep the same shirt decent for years? how often would you like to buy yourself some drip? how often in a week would you like to be dripped out👘?  do you prefer winter clothing or summer clothing? 

 How to Clean 
is there a chore you really dont prefer to be the one doing? do you clean things up even when you don’t feel like it, or rest first? do you like to clean stuff after the first use? do you usually have a preference for how you want stuff organised? is there anything that brings you a mood that makes chores doable? how long should it take to fix a broken door handle? do small stains bother you? would you throw something away because its gotten rusty? would you consider it painful to clean a mess that wasn’t made by you? how often you like to wash your hair ? is perfume an occasional thing or for on the regular? for how long do you really like to bathe? do you like to be without shoes in our house? would you ever let the kids make a mess? is there a room in the house that should aways be kept clean? what is one thing that would calm you down if you were feeling crowded? 

How to be at Home
would you lke me to drive you to and fro work? would you like to go to a place of worship on a regular basis? would you like to attend our community’s meetings(politics)? would we visit clubs? what about quieter bars? how often would you like us to visit the 🏀courts? with to your doctors appointments? what kind of teachers would you want for your children to have? would you like to have me speak with the waiter for you? would you like me to be the one who pays for stuff at the cashier? how do you think you’d want me to behave to the women in our neighbourhood? how would you behave to the men in our neighbourhood? 
to make acquaintance with strangers? how much about your life would you like your neighbours know? would you let me put a tracker on you? would you let me put trackers on our kids? how well would you like to get to know the parents with whom’s kids yours are friends? how would wanna react to me if you feel like olwethu is overstaying his welcome? 

How to be Outside
if you couldn’t speak my language, how do you think you’d try to let me know that..? would you mind to live in a community where the laws weren’t aligned to your morals? would you go to a cinema where the movies aren’t in your language? do you have any opinion about ‘xhenophobia’? how would you wanna react if a cop was being disrespectful? if you were asked to would you be willing to say a prayer that isn’t to your god? How would it make you feel if you had to wear a hijabi to be allowed into someplace? I hear they live under socialism in russia, would you be willing to have everything and our salaries be the same as our neighbours? I hear there’s no privacy in china, would you mind to visit a place where the government monitors every phone? How would you handle managing it if our daughter was studying overseas? How would you wanna ask a jew your questions about the holocaust?

I'd tell you nges Xhosa baba .♉

No.

Le gama ngathi ye disease. 💀

An elemental conversation. 

in this video are two kids with a goal. i'd like to note the mental dynamics there with their two elemantal virtues. where one is from the land of earth, the other from the land of fire.    

more inclined to the right-brain perspective, more aware in that carefree flow of nature, the fire nature is receptive to its e'motions'. and passionately is how fire spreads in these fluids, the feelings. the fire kid so wants to adress his discontent with their dis-harmony  

more inclined to the left-brain perspactive. more aware to the logic of cause and effect. the earth nature is so receptive to the reason. "i am doing this because", the focus is to build a map to the optimal solution, or that comfortable space. where the earth kid seeks to control how they harmonize. 

the fire kid learns from the earth, not to let their flame burn into all the fluids. reason may be employed to decipher which feelings are not-productive. so we may better align ourself to those things that are benefitial. 


the earth kid learns from the fire, not to often overlook their feelings. and to see that the is always more space to grown into.

The story is called *Seek* . 🔎 
 
your favourite colour is bleu, still you remind me of the colour pink and all the rainbow. your tongue has a different taste, still your skin is sweet. And us being together hastens the hands of our clocks. this as a bedtime story, not a rhythmn nor a lullaby. still i struggle to speak as plainly, because all my thoughts about you are poetic. we're smooth, we harmonize. your body has a language i listen, i so love how you speak to me. 
our reward won't be in the anniversares, instead in the experiences we have of us together; how well we're acquainted, this union we've come to . the feel of this wonderful web we weave . 

my love in swahili, my love in portuguesse, my love in xhosa . my love i wish this ink was coloured how your heart is patterned . say it for me to hear it in your voice . because love, for me, is weaved there in the sound of your voice.

note to self

i did❣️ ..i notice about myself that i kinda have a very hard time getting into the zone when it comes to focusing on my work. it really feels uncomfortable when i try, my mind don't like it. i been like this for i'd say 3 years now. 
3 years before that the opposite was true for me. i miss that.

this new me only likes to focus when its sum ♓️energies; stuff like reading the bible  comes easy for me. unfornately we dont live ina pisces dreamland, id def be better of with some ♍️virgo energies being practical. like spending hours in this code👨🏾‍💻. 
i'm thinking about getting back to an exercising🏋️‍♂️  routine; so that those practicality muscles can rub off on other areas of my life

Seek

The story is called *Seek* . 🔎 

A broken hearted young girl she was , given up on love coz she never got genuine love from anyone . Even so , she had so much love insider her , shocking right ... ? She never imagined loneliness would seep into her heart so viscerally. It didn’t arrive announced or with a loud voice. No, loneliness sneaks around in stealth and works its way into your heart until you find yourself scrolling dating apps until 2 am or asking friends to hook you up w any cute guy they know . She had talked & met a few guys & ladies but it didn't work out coz they not what she'd typically date coz peeps me mad crazy outtchea ! She kept on looking & looking until she finally decided to stop & give up . She was convinced  there was no love coz what is love exactly . Not even your carrier loves herself enough to love you . She seemingly fell into loneliness depression & started neglecting herself each day . She didn't understand the all dating concept shandis as it was complicated and messy that the thought of giving up sounds almost appealing coz I guess being lonely is much better than being lied to . Whenever she be busy on her phone & bump into love stories she be very emotional & say " i want that " . She prayed to love & be loved genuinely everday , she even wrote some notes about it . Fast Forward , Girlings found herself stuck in a toxic environment & never knew what to do . But one day she met this guy that she liked "as a friend " thou . 🫣 They started talking via text & she noticed something ...omg , the nigga is cool . She honoured every chance she got talking to him . It was very much unexpected & fast but she was falling for the nigga each day .She found herself being attached talking to him & always expecting a text from him whenever she be online . However , she noticed something , nigga be offline for days or late replies & that used to hurt her . She got mad for getting mad bout that situation then she realized how much she really kikes this nigga . As much as she preferred f2f vibes she would've appreciated some reassurance as she was a massive overthinker . She said "Life is a long, winding, unpredictable journey. It’s completely okay to feel down in the dumps about your love life, but writing it off completely? Don’t even think about it! Things might seem tough right now, but giving up on love isn’t the answer" . & went back home to find out what in the hell is wrong w this nigga . She let ego & pride aside coz not finding out makes her think otherwise bout love such that giving up on "it" creates a close-minded, cynical mindset that’s bound to cause trust and commitment issues negatively :( >> The day came when she finally met him & damn she was so shy & awkward as always . 🙈 They spent alotta time together & decided to get to know each other in order to fall naturally . She found herself wired for love & saw potential in him . It took some work to open herself up again to love, but romance showed up in places she never imagined, and feelings developed unexpectedly. She believed a human heart is weird as it started beating but I guess under the right circumstances . She was fell mad deeply in love w the dude . He was not really her type but what's a type right ? The best part of all this is the found each other & now deeply in love w each other . Btw , It's a forever thing . 💌

how it feel to keep a patent pending from the nosebleed. 
keeping every penny for myself is my directive.

and my niggas that i keep close me untouchable.

write it out my ryuchi cave tample. 
ion wanna say shit these niggas need the mental. 
all these niggas lead like pencil. 
in it when my queen do a keagle. 

on monday imm relax before i get into the flex 
the next day met win freya she a 10, she the goddess.
close to the sun my pen game is flawless 
thought about it, read about it, stuck to the cadence.  
stand for it, motherfuckn critiques is baseless.
saturday i kick back the rhymn scheme backwards. 
scary niggas know how i stick close to my dead ones. 
ass phat and taps two times like thumb drums.

Ryuchi Cave Intercept

A smooth ride through the top floor ceiling. 
JT a top spot placement lord willing. 
back of my index finger i get the feeling then i get me to the sakeral tablets and get to scripting. 
my diptiction, Ryuchi cave 
tapes was a composition 
my position, was to come out ahead with the information. 
in a rhythm, on a beat named martyr the institution. 
I could get a nigga's head from bobbing into a movement. 

my word's bonded in proof and translucent. 
young nigga got the juice and flows fluent. 
young nigga rolls the spiff and goes through it. 
young nigga's
come from the bottom up on the way out. 
i was taught a different type of reading was between the lines. 
surely it was written with spirit that mean its genuine. 
surely if the sun is in Aries, that's go time. 
surely if the sun is in Aries, that's G.O.A.T time. 
fuck about me and get spiked like a pockupine 
1053 with cold blood and a lot of wine. 

i'm, top two and i'm topping that list too. 
i alwxandre mcqueen how i come when beam thru 
schuash da producer he believed in my dream too, 
gave me the first mixtape beat i could think to.  
tooken further now i'm an type exclusive author. 
it's officially then it's on a dezzi beat and no other.
coz these nigga's top two, but my nigga go harder. 
88 more bars for the slimes to decipher, 
there's this thick fat roach in my matchbox counter. 
I got Live like that nigga young stunna
How to keep a crowd Live like that nigga young stunna. 
niggas basic, but brother i'm asic how i run it up. 
my cadence, is surely the greatest and that should back it up...

Heaven’s EP

Dezzi beats made it for me nigha imma have kill it. something they can feel like its 16 holes in it. 
pen on my hand and i can feel it my spirit.

how it feel to be that nigha living in my own planet. 
It’s whatever even when i feel im alone i won’t parish. 
been the type of nigha tell the time with no patek. 
weighing up my words be like 24 karat
Like back when we was living in that rented out apartment
that shit hard for me to say but i was fucking on my cousin  
days unders the sun there’s no sin that i haven’t
so i know im not the one who gonna see the gates of heaven
but fuck it.. see i know you was the one who let it happen. 
got out the mud when uncle had started trapping.
family curses wrap around my neck like a napkin. 


vividly remember they was talking bout the nigha, 
body fuck up and so they wouldn’t let us see him. 
but shit my heart broke when i was looking at that coffin.
won’t you tell me why i had to fight trauma so often. 
You should play this if you ever wonder why im so broken. 

too many scars is on my heart i can’t cope
and when he died he was my last nigha alive i lost hope.

Naruto: How shinobi came to be


A deity who came to earth in search of the Divine Tree. Which is said to be a source of the earths immense chakra. While on earth Kaguya gives birth to two children, Hagoromo and Haruma. And from Her they inherit the ability to wield chakra. The two boys grow and eventually realise that she had been sacrificing humans to keep extracting chakra from the divine tree. Before she is defeated in the confrontation. Kayuga awakens the divine tree. Which comes to life as the Ten Tails and goes on a rampage trying to reclaim its chakra. The brothers seal the tailed beast in Hagoromo, who stays to guard the earth while keeping the Ten Tails contained in himself. Haruma goes to keep guard of their mother on the moon. 
￼

Hagoromo then has two children of his own, Indra and Ashura. To whom he teaches ninshu- the ninja creed. These two would however prove to exhibit polarities in their nature. While Indra was exceptional, a genius who could accomplish more than plenty on his own. Ashura was a dunce, who couldn’t get anything done without depending on others to collaborate upon his best effort. 
He grows to believe that having these relationships with people, that love, is a power as great as the one his brother possesses. It is in this idea of love that Hagoromo envisioned a new world of possibilities. A path more favourable than the one Kayuga was on. And so he made Ashura the leader and guardian of the ninshu creed. Thereafter ninshu was known as the teaching of using chakra as a means to connect people. However, Indra wanted instead to empower himself. He weaponized chakra and in the process gave birth to ninjutsu.

Because of this difference the brothers fought. So much that even after their deaths, their chakra roam the earth and reincarnate in each generation. The first such reincarnates being Hashirama Senju and Madara Uchiha. 
The most recent are Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha. 
￼

And the rest of shinobi being somewhere along the Otsustuki bloodline. One special case being the Hyuga clan of the hidden leaf village. Possessing the Byakugan, a visual ability passed on to them by Kayuga Otsutsuki.

Most of the time I rol a doobie, light it up and then I smoke on my lonely. and let it out. let it loud for my A-N-xiety, isolation and the drought. 
That I been feeling lately. How i'm always missing out on what's trending daily. 
If I still feel like shit then imma go more heavy. I hit the lean, with the vodka.  
though that shits not healthy. what im really  worried 'bout is tryna get more weathly. 
Have my books right, getting in to honors baby. 
I been shook right, dealing with the  trauma baby. 
I ain't been right. thinking you could help me maybe.
that don't sound right, i can do without you baby. 
know my star's bright and I can make it shine lil baby.

Imma swerve right, making it to mines lil baby.

the greatest rappers that died was speaking to him.
like the speakers was the graveyard site he would listen to em. 
arms strong enough to carry the cross he was designated. 
stines long enough to hide all the hatchets he buried them wit. 
 

flipping the scripture, I pictured the book of watchers. 
giantic figures, like missles they came upon us. 
with the truth, that makes your minds eye bloom if you smoke they fauna. 
tell the youth, man if you tried thy shroom, would be where you'll find us. 


and you don't even know me 


I not as romantic as you as you want to be. 

I miss you soo much when you not with me. 
so fuck an ego I'll be giving you the love for free. 
know we like peas in a pot with the chemistry. 
and you the apple of my eye, on my forbidden tree
yo, we could squeeze in a pod if you ride for me. 
and we'lll forever stay preaching the monogamy. 
and break bread, make plans for eternity. 
i know i better, keep reaching when your not with me. 


boyy i found real love in my momma and best friends. 
coz they knew needed that, when i'm making these fligh plans. 
they knew i would be bakkk on they earth when  

and when i feel my feelings fully, 
i know when my stomach turns
 and i know where my fears can rule me. 
you no wiser me no wiser, im finding it to my real me. 
non the wiser, no adivisers, words be a bond to the filthy. 
he smoking this bag of fifthy, while waiting in line, reefer done, reaper coming to pick me when the stars align. intertwine, 
intimate done divinely. at my last times, no crime, crying out for my baby (like). 
.
you taught about the trinity so one is the division. 
but hidden from visibilty, cherubs had four rankings. 
and hid from my intuition the devil as fifth placed. 
.
work on a mind that search for the truth. 
and for you, same shit that have me dying im tryna stress in the booth
. 
iss jt, and man im so nice i'll say it twice. its JT
you know i love it when im high. ha-ha ha-ha



they mad because I'm smoking all these greens
but never break at the seams. 
and still am chasing my dreams, 
and I fly so high, like i have god on my wings  


because the blacker the berry  
the more im squeezing the titty. 


I might cuff her coz that ass fantastic, elastic.
how it juggle when she let me clap it, magic. 

and my blood brand new, i took a covent nigga. 
i took the cross so my nigga could take a w.

a nigga just got paid and he made sure his niggas have some.
shawty think im hatian, im a gremlin, but im handsome.


skippin classes in the balconyyy im smoking weeed. 
and to be honest im not stopping till my lungss bleeeeed


you know if I loved you back it would be dangerous. 
you unstable i don't think you can sustain us.

moving quiet but i promise imm a loud nigga. 
i been i been, i been climbing these trees nigga. 
i been i been, i been high im out my knees nigga.

smoke extensive i take it as meditative. 
my lung span is impressive. 
this greener grass is expensive. 
cannot pass it, smoking passive. 
im silent when going through it (ahhh) 
im signed coz my rythmn fluent. 
these lines make visions lucid.
i'm trying but i might lose it. 

why would you play on meee.
you know i got the type of shawties that's gon pray for meee.
thats why in everythhing i do i do it faithfullllly.
and that's why when i make a move i do it gracefullllyy. 

and so flat the earth was. i walked along a path that sowed forth a dead
when i was going down, or so said revererend. 
for the last time, for my feel of heaven. 
know im falling but im fly when i take this poision. 
seen the ceiling, but im high, you can't halt my cause 
so i'm reaching for that sky, when they stop my noise. 

put aside the matches now my candle light beaming.
grudges in my ashes now, i found that shit freeing. 
have to set intentions 'fore you find your life's meaning (ayy)

can't stay near me i'm a fan of the truth. 
coz see you have your own family im not dying with you. 
but you know it, if they coming, then im lying for you. 


lost my art, torn apart, had my life shook. 
had it hard, see my shawty, i had her throat shook. 

at this point the joint in my hand's the brand. 

roll a joint, go to class, it aint a thing to me. 
visine, white eyes, momma proud of me. 

weed is the only thing i smoked since high school. 
weed is the only thing that cope, being in my room.
weeed is the only thing, im taking to my tomb

what my momma said to a ten year old kid. 
was you have to stay alert, you might miss it if you blink. 
gotta clear your plate before you put it in the sink. 


I smoke weed because I struggle to relax. 
I need peace, 

stays with the keys, certified playlisting. 
made micasa i was bloemfontein haze. 

what you know bout crying for your spirit? 
...go through it heal through it you gotta relive it. 


this new shit im on, can't find it no where 
this shit im on, need you to go where I laid feet upon. 



i know who i is and if i told em they would still doubt. 
uhhh, and so im, so im  rolling up a big cloud, 
sipping on a milk stout. 
and i'm not folding no clothes that's a bitch job. (yrh yrh) 
and i'm not biting no beef, shooting head tops. (brre brer)  
yeaahh woke up feeling like my dick was in a bitch mouth yeah 
in my ocean i be swimming catching big trout. 


woke up, hit the blunt, then i felt like writing some fire shit.
tho i just begun, i decided that this some fire shit.
i'm not the one you can try compare your standards with. 
Had to get myself to the gouda i was a gutters kid. 
fucking up a drum and i slide like i got the gliders with.
switch in the middel and bring it back coz i'm talented. 

man i can prove it , i could fiddle with a riddle 
and put my tounge on a paddle. 
 and put my pad to the scribble. 
And still not sound like i mumble. 
Dr Seuss these words, make swirls, and pull pearls. out they meaning, and make verbs. 
that i'm thinking will break curse out the living 


you niggas monotone, 
After a couple rhymes or so I always seem so switch the tone. 

Thought i had some friends, but fuck it forget about it. 
I don't see the point if i go out and post about it.

woke up i aint got no morning text, but dezi sent the beats so imma go ahead and write that. 

puff puff, no sir i dont pass. 
coz i don't have no friends and all this weed cost cash. 
and i smoke it by the thousand so you know it wont last. 

nigga's think this shit a joke but it's my life forreal. 
if a nigga couldn't cope he mighta died forreal. 



We born kings in them streets that we used fight each other
And i would beat your little ass like I'm your bigger brother. 
still you never saw me less, i know you love me harder. 
how I hate to be the reason we was growing farther. 
Coz i was mad you was the only one one who had a father. 
broke that bridge and now we feel like the straits of gibraltar. 
shit cut deep, coz what we had it was thicker than water. 
but my apologies run deeper than me shedding blood.
coz shit i couldn't treat you better when we had it hard. 
see this shit on top of the table aint no fuckn cards. 
i'm just trying to show you the place at where my demons start.  
i'm just tryna to show the wrongs that i could 
never right/write.
